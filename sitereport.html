                <p>This report describes my experience learning the fundamentals of web development, coding, design, and debugging. To gain knowledge and hands-on experience in these areas, I enrolled in an online course.<br> HTML, CSS, responsive design, and debugging techniques were among the topics covered in the course. <br>In this report, I'll talk about my experiences with each of these topics and how I'm feeling about my progress.
