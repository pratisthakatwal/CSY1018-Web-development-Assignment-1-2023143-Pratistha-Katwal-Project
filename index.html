                 <p>This report describes my experience learning the fundamentals of web development, coding, design, and debugging. To gain knowledge and hands-on experience in these areas, I enrolled in an online course.<br> HTML, CSS, responsive design, and debugging techniques were among the topics covered in the course. <br>In this report, I'll talk about my experiences with each of these topics and how I'm feeling about my progress.
                     The website's purpose was to provide information about the company and its services, as well<br> as to allow users to contact the company.The website was built with modern web development<br> technologies,and the user interface (UI) design was carefully considered to ensure the best possible user experience.This report contains. HTML and CSS were used to create the website.The design of the website's UI was carefully considered to ensure an optimal user experience.The color scheme was chosen to be visually appealing and to create a professional look and feel.The pink and the purple color<br> choosen depicts cool  tones and also describes the person I am “very cool.” I found the web development course module to be both challenging and rewarding. The module introduced me to the basics of web <br>development, coding, design.The course material was well-organized and easy to follow, with a good mix of theory and practical examples. One of the key takeaways from the module was learning how to create <br>responsive websites that work well on all devices. This was a new concept to me, and I was impressed by the techniques used to make websites look great on mobile devices and desktop</p>
